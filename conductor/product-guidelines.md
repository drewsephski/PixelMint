# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Efficient:** The interface uses direct and clear language. Every word is chosen to facilitate productivity.
- **Goal-Oriented:** Communication focuses on the outcome (creating content) rather than the process (manipulating AI).

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Clean & Modern:** The UI prioritizes high contrast and significant white space to minimize distractions and keep the focus on the generated images.
- **Achromatic Foundations:** To ensure the user's content remains the hero, the interface uses a neutral palette. 
- **CRITICAL:** Avoid blue/purple gradients in the UI design.

## User Experience Principles
- **Inspirational Empty States:** Instead of blank screens, the app greets users with high-quality templates and "What's possible" galleries to immediately spark creative direction.
- **Workflow Over Configuration:** The UX is designed around the social media creation lifecycle (Select Style -> Generate -> Resize -> Export).

## The "Never" Rules
- **Never Overwhelm:** Avoid deep menus or hidden settings. Core tools must be accessible within one or two clicks.
- **Never Delay:** Interface responsiveness is paramount. We use optimistic UI updates and clear progress indicators to minimize perceived latency.
- **No Technical Jargon:** Terms like "Latent Diffusion," "Inference Steps," or "CFG Scale" are strictly prohibited in the primary UI to maintain accessibility.

## Primary User Sentiment
- **"This tool understands my needs as a creator."** Every feature and interaction should reinforce the feeling that the app was built specifically for the social media professional's unique workflow.
